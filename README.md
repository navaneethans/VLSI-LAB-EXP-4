PROCEDURE:
STEP:1  Start  the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2  Select the device family, device, package and speed.       
STEP:3  Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.                       
STEP:4  Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.
STEP:5  Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.                       
STEP:6  Click the simulation to simulate the program and  give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.               
STEP:7  Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window.
STEP:8  Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize  XST Process. Double Click in the  FloorplanArea/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 
STEP:9  In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu.
STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here.
STEP:11  On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
